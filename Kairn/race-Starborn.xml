			<p class="flavor">Flint squinted into the setting sun. The horse felt uneasy underneath him, the unnatural quiet before the storm unsettling both him and his mount. Assembling in uneven lines, todays adversaries were as varied as they were imposing. The occasional giant stood towering over their goliath brethren, the unnaturally large half-humans now appearing tiny by comparison. Yet most dazzling of all were their ally, the mythical starborn. They were smaller than the goliaths, but their other physical characteristics made them as, if not more, oustanding. Luminious hair and eyes shining like gemstones, they looked more suited to paintings than the rages of war. Some sported smaller antlers while others had tiny horns, but all of them possessed the signature constellations, glowing patches of night sky with linked stars, vividly living on their skin.</p>
            <p class="flavor">Flint slowly drew his sword, the order to ride would arrive soon. His adversaries seemed similarly prepared and while the goliaths and giants hefted their weapons, the starborn started putting up their small magical lights and ready their spells. Flint spat, he hated being in the vanguard and the lights would make it impossible to sneak away..</p>
            <p class="flavor">"At least we'll die looking at something pretty" Damon, his swordmate, said. Flint nodded solemnly as the trumpet to charge sounded across the battlefield.</p>

            <p>The ancient allies of the giants and the mysterious sages of the stars, the starborn stand wholly aside from the humans, yet their destiny is underniably linked. The starborn originate from the ancient, now dead world of the giants, who by their unity were the crafters of the stars. Now, trapped in a new and hostile world, the starborn were reduced to mere giant legend, but have returned to reintroduce the glory of the stars to the world.</p>
			<h4>Children of Stardust</h4>
			<p>The starborn were forged from stardust and are defined by this origin. Though they bear some resembleance to humans, it would be hard to confuse the two races. Starborn tend to tower slightly over most other races, usually being no shorter than 6 feet, but usually not taller 7 feet. Their builds are more lean than humans and are more similar to elves, although not quite as lithe. Starborn have a variety of defining features in addition to their unique proportions; They have vibrant eyes whose color palette is as diverse as the rainbow. They have shining hair, usually the color of the night sky or the stars. Notably, starborn have antlers, that can vary from small stumps on their head, to glorious racks that would challenge even moose. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but notably has differently colored patches, with luminous constellations decorating the area. These patches are usually either purple, light blue or black.</p>
			<h4>Constellation Designers</h4>
            <p>While their ancient compatriots, the giants, forged the stars, the starborn arranged them into the beautiful displays that would eventually make the night sky. The starborn were made smaller and nimbler, with great social capabilities to allow for the careful creation of the great star tapestry. Although they could be highly competitive, the starborn tended to live in harmony, trusting each other to be of good heart.</p>
            <p>In the new world, the starborn have had to make due with much more hostility. Some have taken to the tranquil nature to pursue artistic passions, but others again have become smaller influencers, attempting to restore the world to the harmonies of their ancient. Many of the kinder are city clerks, merchants, advisors, while those more cruel in their methods might be local warlords or controlling mages.</p>
            <h4>Endearing Foreigners</h4>
            <p>Starborn, not being native to the land, are often viewed with suspicion and sometimes hostility. Over time, they may adapt to return this and many end up becoming cynical and closed off. However, they rarely let this affect their outward display, and although they might take a long time to truly love someone internally, they usually at least attempt friendship unless that trust is violated. Starborn are natural leaders and others will often flock to them, both because of their good nature and their charming personality.</p>
			<p>Many starborn often hide their more revealing traits and some might be confused for elves or tall humans for most of their life. A few starborn do use their unique apparence to inspire awe or terror at those around them.</p>
